<p>Port Arthur, January 6.</p>
<p>Generals Nogi and Stoessel had a two hours
conference yesterday. It is proposed to distri-
bute the sick and wounded among the hospitals
in the Chinese ports.</p>
<p>The Russian battleships here have not yet
been officially inspected, but it is believed that
in the haste with which they were blown up
they were only damaged in the upper parts. It
is hoped they may be repaired.</p>
<p>Reuter's correspondent before Port Arthur
reports that all the regular troops marched out
today and proceeded to Dalny. The Japanese
contingents have entered the city to preserve
order. Japanese sailors are removing the mines
and the Japanese hulks at the entrance of the

<p>London, January 6.</p>
<p>The singer Madam Belle Cole is dead. (R.)</p>
<p>Madam Belle Cole, who will be greatly
missed in London musical circles, and who has
been so prominently before the public as a
prima-donna of the concert-room for many
years, was born at Chautauqua, U.S.A. She
received her first musical training at the hands
of her father, and was for a time soloist in a
fashionable church in New York. Going to
England in 1888, she soon made a great repu-
tation in that country, achieving great success
at the Crystal Palace Handel festivals, Mon-
day Popular and other Ballad concerts. She
made a festival tour through Australia and
New Zealand, and a tour round the world in
1901, returning in January, 1902, to England,
where she remained till her death.</p></div>

of February. Admiral Rozdjestvensky is to be
recalled.	(Reuter.)</p>

<p>The Asphalting of Clot Bey-street, Cairo,
will be finished by the 20th inst.</p>
<p>The Brindisi Mail will close at the G.P.O.,
Alexandria, on Monday at 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>The Opera Season at the Khedivial Opera
House, Cairo, will probably commence on
Saturday next with Rigoletto.</p>
<p>Novelli, the great Italian tragedian, is
expected to come to Egypt this season and
will give a series of performances at Cairo
and Alexandria.</p>
<p>Austro-Hungarian Benevolent Society.-
The annual ball of the Austro-Hungarian Bene-
volent Society of Alexandria will be given at
the New Khedivial Hotel on Saturday, 28th inst.</p>
<p>New Markaz Courts.—By the 15th inst, a
court will be established in every markaz and
will commence work on that date, as well as
in the kisms of the different gouvernorats.</p>
<p>Suez Canal.—On the 1st And 2nd inst 32
vessels passed through the Canal, the receipts
for the two days being frs. 428,751.11. 20 of
the ships were British, 2 Austrian, 1 French,
1 Norwegian, 4 German, 1 Dutch, 1 Swedish,
1 Turkish, 1 Italian.</p>
<p>Cairo Customs.—We are asked to remind
the public that, as from the 15th inst, goods
of every description may be sent in bond to
Cairo, where the Customs dues may be paid,
in accordance with the official notice of the
26th November, 1904, published in our
columns.</p>
<p>Discoveries at Sakhara.— The Antiquities
Department has applied for a credit of L.E.
1,500 for excavations at Sakhara, where it is
believed that many most precious relics are
concealed. The excavations will continue for
a considerable time, fresh credits being asked
for when needed.</p>
<p>Alhambra Theatre.—The variety show at
this theatre is still keeping up the standard of
excellence with which it opened, and fresh
debuts are continually taking place. Matinees
are to be given this afternoon and to-morrow.

formance to-day and to-morrow.</p>
<p>Cairo British Consulate. — It is expected
that the work of building the new Cairo Con-
sulate will be begun in February, and that
it will be completed about the end of next
year, the cost being estimated at £4,000. Aa
we have already mentioned, a site was pur-
chased some months ago opposite the American
Diplomatic Agency, near the Savoy Hotel, in
the very centre of the Ismailia quarter.</p>
<p>Tourist Developments- The amalgamation
of Stangen's Tourist Office with the Hamburg-
American line is expected to have important
results in developing Egypt’s tourist traffic.
Stangen, as is well known, is the German
"Cook." From small beginnings Stangen's
institute has developed to a very important
tourist office, whose domain at first was only
Germany, but which has increased its business
immensely by catering for the pleasure traffic
throughout the world at large.</p>
<p>Mr. Bensilum's Suicide-The body of Mr.
Bensilum, late of the Wkfs Administration,
who determined to commit suicide in con-
sequence of his discharge from the adminis-
tration, has been found in the Nile near
Boulac and removed to Kasr-el-Ainy Hospi-
tal, where a coroner's inquest was held
yesterday. The body was in an advanced
state of decomposition, having been in
the water for several days. - The only arti-
cles found on deceased's body were two keys and
a piece of paper. The inquest was adjourned to
Monday.</p></div>
<div type="item"> <head>RAMLEH ELECTRIC RAILWAY</head>
<head>THE BOARD CAPITULATES.</head>
<p>The details of the result of the meeting of
the board of directors of the Alexandria and
Ramleh Railway Company have not been di-
vulged, but we are authorised to state that the
board decided to meet the demands of the
Ramlehites, and that when the full details of
the concessions are given to the public at the
mass meeting this evening, the general opinion
will be that a highly satisfactory solution has
been arrived at in answer to the agitation that
has prevailed during the past week.</p>
<p>The action of the board of directors in meet-
ing the legitimate demands of the inhabitants
of Ramleh we acknowledge to be the only
prudent course in face of the outburst of po-
pular discontent which has greeted the impo-
sition of the tarif on New Year’s Day. The
discontent thereby aroused will thus be as-
suaged, and the storm and stress of the past
week will be followed by a feeling of relief at
the crisis having been brought to an end, by
the way in which the capitalists who guide the
destinies of the company have bent before
the blast of popular fury and indignation
which the imposition of the new system of
fares had evoked from every section of the
population of Ramleh.</p>
<p>The Ramlehites are to be heartily congra-
tulated on having secured such a signal victory
on this important point. The magnates, who
form the board, have fully recognised the
justice of the outcry which they have raised ;
and hare been obliged to confass that the
heavy exactions, which the recently imposed
system would have made on the income of the
clients of the company, were as unwise as they
were inequitable.</p></div>
<div type="item"> <head>THE MASS MEETING.</head>
<p>At the great meeting of Ramlehites, which
will be held at the theatre at Bacos this even-
ing, Mr. Benjamin Arbib, the chairman of the
Ramleh Delegation, will give a detailed exposi-
tion of the propositions which the board of
directors has submitted to him and Iris fellow
delegates.</p>
<p>The meeting has been summoned for 9 o'clock
and considering the importance of the issues at
stake, there ought to be a large and represent-
ative attendance. All who have the interests of
Ramleh at heart are cordially invited to attend
the mass meeting.</p></div>
<div type="item"> <head>THE DELEGATION.</head>
<p>The energetic attitude of the Ramleh dele-
gates has evoked the hearty gratitude of the
public, for owing to their having adopted a
forward policy the directors have been enabled
to gauge the strength of the popular backing
of these gentlemen, Messrs. Arbib, Stross and
Zenie. As. there appears to be some connection
in the minds of the public as to the connection
between the Ramleh and Ibrahimieh Protec-
tion Committee and the delegates of the Ram-
lehites, we may state that these two bodies are
quite distinct from one another. The delegates
of the Ramlehites are the party of the Extreme
Left, who, in view of the exigences of the situ-
ation, embarked on a “forward" policy. It is
they who summoned the public meeting, issued
the manifestoes and indulged in the manifesta-
tions which took place at the beginning of the
week. It is they who awoke the Ramlehites to
a sense of the impending danger and, by
their activity and organisation and insistence
tarif, have made themselves the champions of
the popular cause.</p></div>
<div type="item"> <head>THE COMMITTEES POLICY.</head>
<p>The Committee for the Defense of the In-
terests of Ibrahimieh and Ramleh represent
the more moderate party, and their system of
agitation is less inflammatory. They adopted
the more constitutional line of policy of ap-
pealing direct to the Government. The petition
which they have addressed to the Minister of
Public Works, and which we published in full
in yesterday’s issue, is being carefully consi-
dered by the Government, as the points raised
therein are of great importance and were
attentively weighed and considered before
being submitted to the attention of the
authorities at Cairo. The names of the mem-
bers of the committee, which were appended
to the petition, embrace the feeding Ramleh-
ites. The reply of the Government has not yet
been received.</p></div>
<div type="item"> <head>THE POPtLAR ALTITUDE.</head>
<p>Since the issue of the manifesto of the dele-
gates on the withdrawal of the posse of Alex-
andria City Police from the town terminus of
the line, the attitude of the Ramlehites has
been characterised by calmness and self-
restraint, and there hare been no incidents to
mar the public tranquillity. The determined
attitude of a section of the Ramlehites in
face of the police served to clear the air and
create a plain issue between the public and
the company. The tactful policy of the
company in withdrawing the police allayed
the growing irritation in the nick of time and
encouraged a revulsion of feeling in favor
of many of the Ramlehites against the
police, that, had the company insisted on main-
taining them at the terminus, continued dis-
order would hare been the inevitable outcome.
However, “alls well that end’s well“ and all
parties concerned are to be congratulated on
having surmounted such a difficult and dan-
gerous crisis in the history of the great east-
ern suburb of Alexandria.</p></div>

<div type="item"> <head>LA SEMAINE FINANCIERE.</head>
<p>Le march de cette semaine a presente une
grande animation, en depit des fetes. La plu-
part des veleurs de soot raffermies et certaines
d’entre elles accusent une hausse sensible. La
mauvais humour qui avait jusque-la regne
sur le marche a completement disparu pour
faire place a l'entrain. Ce resultat est du a ce
que le marche des valeurs est presque indepen-
dent de celui des contrats. La plupart des
fortes positions en titres, detenues par le*
speculateurs en cotons ayant ete liquidees
pour faire face aux pertes de ces der-
niers temps, il n’y a plus, pour le mo-
ment du moins, a craindre ces ventes forcees
qui ont exerce une si funeste influence sur le
marchs des valeurs. De plus, bon nombre de
courtiers abandonnent peu a peu la corbeille
des contrasts, ou le calme domine maintenant,
pour passer dans la corbeille des valeurs ou
les operations sont devenues plus lucratives.
On espere que cette fois les prix ne seront pas
poysses a des niveaux trop dangereux, comme
cels s’est produit il y a quelques semaines.</p>
<p>Les marches europeans paraissent fort peu
affectes des derniers nouvelles de la guerre:
au contraire, le ton y est plus ferme. L'escompte
qui etait tombe jusqu'a 2 3/8, (e* qui montre
que le numeraire abonde), remonte aujour-
d'hui a 2 1/2. Le consolide, qui avait attaint
88 7/8, reactionne a 88 3/8. Les valeurs
egyptiennes sont en faveur a Londres, tres
probablement par suite de forts ordres d'achats
provenant d'Egypte.</p>

<p>An interesting legal question as regards

whether a newspaper can be allowed to lay
before its reader* the report of a juge d’in-

parts of Europe newspapers have only the
right of indicating the results of the ma-
gisterial examination, and are prohibited from

has pronounced in favor of the exercise of
such a right by the Press.</p></div>

Tomisani appeared, and was, if possible, even
better than in Mignon. He has an exception-
ally good voice, and should certainly be heard
of again in Europe. Signa. Malaspina sang
very well on the whole, though a trifle shrill
and too loud at times. The orchestra were
also at times guilty of the same fault, but
they amply compensated for that by their
admirable rendering of the charming and
well-known overture to the 4th act.</p>
<p>Signor Tomisani reappeared last night
in La Sonnambula, and those who were present
will, we are certain, agree that he is in every
way a tenor really worth hearing.</p></div>

<head>MENA HOUSE GYMKHANA</head>
<p>Quite a large number of visitors and re
sidents had gathered at Mena House for the
Gymkhana yesterday, and though the weather
was neither very warm nor very sunny, it was
infinitely better than at the last Gymkhana,
which was spoiled by the wet. The arrangements
made were as good as ever and the prizes
greatly admired. Two races, the 7th and the
9th, were not run through lack of entries, but
in all the rest there were plenty, especially in
the 5th(Umbrella and Cigarette Race on Donkeys)
where many unsuccessful aspirants for lady
partners had to be literally driven from the
course. The following are the results of the
various events:-</p>
<p>Donkey Race for Gentlemen. — A fairly
good race ended in a victory for Mr. Cotton
Fox. Osman Bey Rodwan was second.</p>
<p>Hack Race (Ponies and Galloways).—Won
by Mr. Michaelides by over a length from Mr.
Cotton Fox. The rest were nowhere.</p>
<p>Egg and Spoon Race for Ladies on Don-
keys-—This event caused great amusement
and several eggs came to grief. Mrs Bailey
won, Mrs. Campbell being a good second.</p>
<p>Hack Race (Horses).—After a good race
Mr. Michaelides beat Kamel Effendi.</p>
<p>Cigarette and Umbrella Race on Don-
keys—The course was crowded with com
petitors. Mr. Moore and Miss Briscoe were the
winners, Mme. and Saleh Bey Cherif being
good seconds.</p>
<p>Mena Cup.—In this event, Mr. Lockett
checked Mr. Michaelides' list of successes
and won narrowly, Mr. Michaelides being
second and Mr. Millar third.</p>
<p>The Ladies' Hack Race was not run, but
two teams had entered for the 8th event:</p>
<p>Lloyd Lindsay Race on Ponies, which
resulted in a win for Capt Biggs's team in
1 min 25 secs. Capt Davis's team were second
in 1 min. 49.</p></div>

<p>It is rumoured that Dr. Ballet, the son-in-
law of De Martino Pasha, will shortly have an
important post conferred on him in the house-
hold of the Khedive.</p>
<p>It is announced that Mr. Macaulay has bean
promoted to the post of Secretary-General of
the Customs Administration.</p>
<p>The friends of Sir Charles Cookson will be
glad to know that his 75 years press lightly
upon him. He still quotes Pindar in the ori
ginal, and loves his Dickens, and believes the
harbour of Alexandria second to none.</p>
<p>The Baroness de Malortie is making a long
stay at Oxford, where she is preparing a vol-
ume for publication. Donnish critics, who
have been privileged to have a look at the
MSS., are by no means sparing in their com-
pliments, and many distinguished scholars on
the banks of the Isis are watching the incuba-
tion of this publication with great interest.
We shall publish in an approaching issue the
first instalment of a beautiful poem on an
Egyptian subject by the Baroness.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mn. G. A Williams have gone for
a short trip up the Nile, and will be absent
about three weeks.</p>

leh, to Mr. Arthur H. Payton, of Solihall,

be a reception in the house of the bride's
father after the ceremony.</p>
