            <div type="item"><head> Offical Spelling</head>
            <p> HAs not the time arrived for a stereotyped
            spelling of the names of towns and villages in
            Egypt! The present variety is more con-
            fusing than pleasing. The Journel Officiel
            often contains several spellings fo the same
            place according as the name is being used by
            the Public Works, Railway, Finance or
            other administraion. Nor is an administration
            always uniform in its method, for the Railway
            Administration sometimes exhibits in time-
            table, telegrphic guide, tickets, station home-
            boards, and lamps all the various forms of
            spelling. Here are some illustrations of variety
            taken from official sources:Kalioubieh, Galiou-
            bieh, Qualiubia; Guzieh, Guiza, Giza; Kena,
            Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut;
            Ebchan, Ebshan, Ibshan; Barqnaqs, Barknaks.
            When names can be found indifferently
            under the inital K Kh H C G or Q it is quite
            a labor to consuly an index.</p></div>

                <p> Some years ago the Indian Government
                adopted a uniform system of spelling on the
                Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it
                is quite time the Egyptian Government did the
                same. The stereotyped form could be left to the
                Survey Department, who have already nearly
                completed a survey of Egypt embracing every
                single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit.
                This department could issue a general index,
                and also a geographical list with mudiriehs,
                districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much
                use in fixing exact name and locality. Press
                notices of village occurrences are at times
                very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud,
                often erroneously called Tel, is now spelt
                Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The names
                of natives is a great source of error, and a
                properly-spelt list would be of much ser-
                vice. A native's identity is at times lost in
                the vagaries of spelling.</p>

            <p>Tokio, January 1.</p>
            <p>The Japanese yesterday, after exploding a
            series of minus, stormed and captured Sung-shu-shou, one of the most important of the remaining forts at Port Arthur. The Russians exploded mines as they were retreating. A portion of the garrison was buried under the
            debris but rescued by the Japanese, who
            captured some guns. The Japanese losses were
            small. There is every indication that the
            defensive power is weakening.</p>
            <p>The Japanese to day captured H fort and
            the new Palung-shan fort, together with the

            <p>During the week ending on Saturday last
            57 deaths from bovine typhus were reported
            throughout Egypt During the corresponding
            period last year, 7,169 deaths were reported.
            A slight recrudescence of the disease is noted
            daring the last week, but this is entirely of a
            local character, confined to the provinces of
            Gharbieh and Ghizeh.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of the outbreak the
            cattle of the localities infected and neighbouring villages have been inoculated with
            serum. This has always checked the development oI the disease. The quantity of serum at the disposal of the Sanitary Administration is
            amply sufficient for inoculation in case of
            local outbreaks, and a constant supply is
            furnished by the Serum Farm. The Administration baa every ground for the hope that
            the disease will have disappeared by the end
            of this year.</p>
            <p>The serum seems to have little or no protective effect with animals coming from
            Cyprus, many of which, though inoculated,
            have succumbed to the disease. Similar
            experiments have been dumJc in India on
            animals coming from the mountains and from
            the plains. The cattle of the plains are protected by the serum, which, however, has little
            or no effect on the mountain cattle, even when
            employed in strong doses. Under these conditions the Sanitary Administration considers
            die importation of Cypriote cattle, as long as
            the epidemic lasts, to be a mistake, as these
            animals are sure to be infected sooner or later.</p></div>

            outside hospital at Kafr el Fokaha, in the
            Toukh Markaz.</p>
            <p>During the week ending the 31st December,
            15 cases of bubonic plague occurred throughout
            Egypt. An increase appears in the number of
            cases occurring at Suez last week. It appears
            from the report that I have received from
            Dr. Cresswell and from my own observations,
            (says Sir H. Pinching in his report) that
            these cases are due to infection conveyed by
            rata, which had been infected themselves by
            goods coming from India or Upper Egypt.
            One of the persons attacked by plague at
            Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains
            large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta
            and tea from Madras. In moving the cases
            containing these goods the dead bodies of rats
            were found. Large quantities of beans have
            also been imported from Upper Egypt, where
            cases of plague occurred this year, the last of

            THE NEW TARIFF.</head>
            <p>The new tariff which came into force yesterday on the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Company's line has aroused a considerable
            amount of indignation among the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Mr. IL II. Birch sends us the following communication on the subject:—</p>
            <p>The directors of tho Ramleh Railway Company, Ltd., have issued a notice that no further contract tickets will be issued after 31st December, 1904, end that in place of them “carnets,” or books of tickets, will be provided at a price which more-than doubles the cost of the yearly contract. The reasons given for this new departure are-</p>
            <p>I “That many contract holders refuse to
            show their tickets to the conductors when
            called upon to do so, and abuse and even
            assault them." The remedy for this is to send
            the offenders before tho Tribunals, and exac
            the penalty for their misconduct.</p>
            <p>II“The company is now a tramway company and no such companies in Europe issue contract tickets.” To this the reply is that it was a railway company when the concession was obtained from the Egyptian Government, and if it has suited the direction to convert the railway into a tramway for their own benefit, it is no reason why the public should be sacrificed.</p>
            <p>The Government, having granted a monopoly
            to the company, should take care that this
            monopoly is not abused. The contract holders
            are mostly old residents, and it is not only
            the proceeds of their tickets that benefit the
            company, but also a further benefit accrues
            from the members of their households and
            guests who visit them and who do not hold
            contracts. What is to be the result of this
            new regulation? The increased charge is
            altogether immensurate to the service rendered by the company. Numbers of people will have to leave Ramleh, and rents, house property, and land will all decrease in value. It behoves everybody to protest energetically against this regulation, which is unjustifiable from ad points of view.</p>
            <p>This morning we interviewed one of the
            members of the board of the company, Mr.
            Lumbroso, who gave us the following exposition of the directors’ standpoint:—</p>
            <p>In no country in the world are there season
            tickets for electric trams, but only books of
            tickets. After the electrification of the line,
            and out of consideration for the public’s demands, season tickets were issued on the condition that every season ticket holder should have his photograph in the ticket case and
            should show it whensoever asked by the company’s servants. But, continued Mr. Lumbreso,
            this system has been rendered impossible
            owing to the "mauvaise volonte” of the public
            and of the tricks played upon the company by
            -false season ticket holders, who insulted and
            attacked the employees when asked to show
            their tickets. The directors have had to stop
            issuing season tickets, and have reduced the
            price of packets of 50 tickets for the first
            class from P.T. 38 to P.T. 75 and for the
            second class from P.T. 4.7 to P.T. 37J. This,
            said Mr. Lumbroso, was a sacrifice made by
            the company for the sake of the public, since
            on a total of about L.E. 50,000 the amount
            realized from season tickets was only L.E. 8,000.
            On the other hand, tho above must take into
            consideration the fact that if the present price
            of the books of ticket appears to be higher
            than the season ticket rate, the new system
            has the advantage of allowing them to give
            away the tickets in the books to their families
            and servants if they wish to.</p></div>

            LIABILITIES £180,000.</head>
            <p>The heavy fail in American cotton has led to the failure of one of the leading Syrian capitalists in Egypt, Mr. Selim Tawil, who belongs to a family which is well known at Alexandria, and whose business connections were very extensive. His speculations were chiefly directed to American cotton, and on Friday last he found himself unable to pay his differences. The amount he has failed for is said to be £180,000. As the Bourse and all the banks are closed today it is impossible for us to obtain complete details of the failure.</p>

<head> A NEW SUEZ CANAL</head>
<head> French Views</head>
<head> Important Interview</head>
<p>The Paris corrrespondent of the Standard,
writing under date of the 18th December sends
the following interesting article to that news-
paper:-</p>
<p>The telegraphic announcement received here
from London that Sir Theodore Angier, of the
shipping firm of Messrs. Angier Brothers, hi
declared that the plans are complete for a
second Canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and
that the contractors are ready to commence its
construction, was calculated to mislead the
general public into the belief that such a second
Canal would really be cut without delay, un-
less to use the words of the despatch, “British
cargo vessels received fairer treatment at the
hands of the present Canal Company."</p>
<p>Before referring to the grievances of certain
shipowners, it is right to point out that the
Suez Canal Company possesses a monopoly
which will not expire till the Canal, at the end
of its concession in about seventy years, passes
into the possession of the Egyptian Govern-
ment. It is, of course, possible that the present
Canal Company should, through violation of
its concession, be pronounced to have forfeited
its monopoly; but at the present time the
complaints do not go so far as that.</p>
<p>It is probable that if the present Company
failed to keep its engagements, the Egyptian
Government, would quash its monopoly, and
perhaps grant another concession to a new
company; but, the British Government, which
possesses no fewer than 176,000 of the Suez
Canal Shares, and has its representatives on the
Board of Directors, has formulated no com-
plaint against the management of the enterprise
which produces for a sufficiently large revenue
to be of appreciable value to the English
Treasury.</p>
<p>If the Canal were mismanaged, the British
Government, as the largest shareholder, would
certainly be the first to complain; but under
present circumstances its representatives are
in perfect accord with the president and other
members of the board of directors, so that
is scarcely likely to advise the Khedive to
grant a concession for a second Canal.</p>
<p>Even supposing the concession were granted
by the Egyptian Government, there would
still remain the question of the Sovereignty
of the Sultan, and of the validity of that con-
cession without the ratification of the Porte.
It is, therefore, clear that if the plans for the
cutting of a second Canal are already prepared,
the moment has not yet come when the con-
tractors can commence their work.</p>
<p>With regard to the Canal dues charged on
the spaces on deck capable of being utilised
for cargo, M. Bonnet, the general secretary
of the Company, assured me to-day that the
regulations for the measurement of those deck
spaces were in complete accord with the deci-
sions of the Constantinople Conference, and
that, moreover, the Board of Trade approved
them. Certain spaces on deck available for
cargo were still exempt, and were only taxed
for the payment of Canal dues after it had
been demonstrated beyond doubt by the ship-
owner himself that they were destined to be oc
copied with cargo by cargo being found in them.
After a vessel has once presented itself in the
Canal with cargo in such previously exempted
spaces, those spaces are for the future always
included in the tonnage on which the Canal
tolls are calculated.</p>
<p>After reading the interview with Sir Theo-
dore Angier, published in The Standard
of Saturday, I called again on M. Bonnet, who
is leaving for Egypt on Tuesday with Prince
d'Arenborg. Their visit to the Isthmus is in
no way connected with the present agitation
in favour of constructing an opposition canal
but is simply the annual visit of inspection al-
ways made by the President of the Suez Cana
Company.</p>
<p>Sir Theodore Angier (as reported in your
issue of December 16) said to your representa-
tives :—"We defeated Mr. Gladstone's assump-
tion of a monopolist right, and he had to con-
foss-that he was wrong. We got a new con-
cession."</p>
<p>“Both these statements,” said M. Bonnet to
me today, “are absolutely incorrect. Mr
Gladstone never contested the Company's
monopoly, and no concession was ever granted
for a second Canal."</p>
<p>The exclusive character of the Suez Canal
Company's concession is unquestionable, espe-
cially as no one contests that the Canal now
completely answers the requirements of the
shipping using it. Sir Theodore Angier com-
plains that the Suez Canal Company has in
many ways violated what is known as “the
London programme," signed in 1883. M
Bonnet's reply on this point was very clear
He said to me, in substance: —‘Sir Theodore
Angier contends that our tonnage measurements
are arbitrary. The fact is that every vessel
using the Canal has two certificates of tonnage.
In the case of British ships,t he Board of Trade
gives first its home certificate of tonnage, and
secondly a Suez Canal certificate, established in
conformity with the regulations of that Com-
pony, drawn up by the Constantinople Con-
ference. Tee Suez Canal authorities naturally
base their Canal dues on this latter certificate,
and make no-arbitrary charges."</p>
<p>“With regard to the question of the di-
vidend, taken in connection with the re-
duction of Canal dues,” went on M. Bonnet
“the ‘London programme' suggested that the
future augmentation of the profits of the
enterprise should be applied in equal parts
to increase the dividend on the shares and
to reduce the Canal dues. Thus, in 1883
when the dividend on the shares was only
93 francs, the Company made its customers,
the shipowners, 4 present of half its even-
toal increased profits. This agreement has
been kept so for several years till 1891,
when there was no surplus to divide, whilst
later on the surplus was sufficient only to
permit of an annual redaction of a few cen-
times per ton. It was unanimously agreed
between all the French and foreign Directors
of the Canal that the reduction of dues
should operate each time the surplus allow-
ed of a reduction of 50 centimes per ton,
and not before."</p>
<p>“If the reduction of one or a fraction
of a centime were made annually, the Com-
pany," said the secretary, "would run the
risk of being obliged in a bad year to
reduce its dividend without being able to
increase the Canal dues. Moreover the divi-
sion of surplus profits is based on tho dm-
dend at the moment of the last diminution
of the toll."</p>
“It was also promised on the ‘London pro-
gramme,’ " pursued M. Bonnet, “that after
tho dividend on the shares should have
reached 25 per cent., or 135 franoa por share, •
the totality of tho surplus profits should1
go towards tho reduction of the Canal duns.
That moment arrived quicker than was
anticipated ; and, immediately .the surplus
profits allow of the reduotion of the present
tell of 8 frauas50 centimes per ton by 50cen-
times, the diminution will be effected- in the
meantime tho dividend has inoroesedand;will
increese, and the further surplus profits,
after each reduction of the tell by 50 ran-'
times, .will, as heretofore, be osculated on the
dividend declared simultaneously with the' 1
lowering of the toll Till now this interpretation 1
of tho ‘London programme' has been uncon- j
tested, and it would evidently be impossible
to get the shareholders of any oompany to 1
accept the position of tho certainty of no .
increase in their dividend with the possibility.*
and oven .tho probability, of a 'reduction in 1
their .inaime owing to tho .foot of all .the 1
surplus profits being employed to reduce tolls
which might, in the case of a period of
prosperity being followed by one of commercial
depression, have boon brought down so low aa 1
to .entail a very heavy lost to the share-
“The next reduotion of fifty rantimra .in the
toll will take place," added M. Bonnot, “when
the dividend on tho share capital has reached
quo hundred and thirty-five J'niues. Each ton !
trance increase of the dividend wiU correspond ,
fur toe future with arednotion of fifty ooutimra ,
in the toll."
As to Sir Theodore Angior’s idea .that the
British directors should bo appointed by the j
British shipowners, M. Bonnet pointed out to .
mo what Prince d'Arenborg wrote some woeks (
ago, and he declared there could be no ques- ,
non of reversing that decision. The directors
are, as iu every company, selected by tho
board of directors, and their appointment is j
ratified by tho shareholders at the general
meeting.
